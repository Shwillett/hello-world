Git tutorial depository - also background information about me, Shawn Willett.

I enjoy thinking about things. Since 2009 I've spent my time thinking about brains and behavior. Specifically, I enjoy neuroethology and comparitive neurobiology. In an attempt to have more robust code in my scientific endeavors I am using github.
